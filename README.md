# DATS6101_MIDTERM_PROJECT

This is the repository for the Master of Science in Data Science's DATS6101 subject's midterm project for Semester 1 in Fall 2022. This repository consists of an exploratory data analysis of the relationship between an individual's social class, work satisfaction, financial satisfaction, and general happiness using data from the General Social Survey conducted in the United States from 1972 to 2021.

We plotted the data over the entirety of the time and generated interesting insights. We have streamlined the data through relevant and sensible graphical representations, which help any human being make sense of the socio-economic factors and their effect on the happiness of the individuals.

To perform the analysis and present the analyzed data, the following **languages, tools, and formats** were used: **R language, R studio, R Markdown, and Microsoft Power Point.**
